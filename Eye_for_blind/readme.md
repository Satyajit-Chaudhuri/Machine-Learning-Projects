**Problem Statement:**
In this capstone project, a deep learning model is required to be created, capable of expressing the content of an image through speech using caption generation along with an attention mechanism. The project utilizes the Flickr8K dataset and targets a use-case for individuals with visual impairments, enabling them to comprehend images through speech assistance. The generated captions, produced by a CNN-RNN model, will be converted into speech using a text-to-speech library.

This problem statement embodies the amalgamation of both deep learning and natural language processing. An image's attributes will be extracted by an encoder based on CNN architecture, followed by interpretation through an RNN model.
