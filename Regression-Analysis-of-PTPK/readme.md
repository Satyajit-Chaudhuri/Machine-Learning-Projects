## Project Title: Regression Analysis of Logistic Freights for  a Cement Manufacturing Company

### Objective:  PTPK Analysis - To find factors influencing PTPK & Development of a model to predict PTPK (and Rate/MT) for future logistic Zones when certain features are known.

### Methodology:

#### ML Models used: Elastic Net, Decision Trees, Random Forest & XGBoost.

### Outcome: The final model had a R2 score of 0.99. The Model also predicted the relative feature importances which play an important role in determining the PTPK.
