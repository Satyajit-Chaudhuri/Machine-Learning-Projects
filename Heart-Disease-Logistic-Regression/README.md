### Premise:

India accounts for one-fifth of the total deaths occurring from stroke and ischemic heart disease, especially in younger adults according to the World Health Organization. “Cardiovascular diseases affect Indians a decade earlier than their western counterparts and nearly 3 million people die of stroke and heart attack every year. The most unfortunate part is that 40 per cent of those who suffer a heart attack are below the age of 55,” said Dr Harinder K. Bali, Chairman, Cardiac Sciences, Paras Hospitals, Panchkula.

“With the incidences of heart disease deaths rising in India by 34 per cent over the last 26 years, it is time to be aware of this serious issue and take necessary steps to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in the country,” he continued.


Being informed about the risk factors can help people to manage their symptoms early and avoid the chances of a sudden heart attack. (https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/world-heart-day-2021-risk-factors-symptoms-treatment-young-adults-7537442/)


### GOAL: 

**Create a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age,sex, cholesterol, etc...)**
