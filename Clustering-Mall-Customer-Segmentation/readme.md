## Project Name: Mall Customer Segmentation - A Clustering Algorithm based Approach

### About the dataset: 

The dataset gives an account of mall customers and are categorised based on their age, gender, Annual Income, and spending score.


### Goal of the Project: 

- The project aims to check for visible patterns in the data.
- The aim is to find visible clusters amongst the data points and segment them into actionable clusters.
- The project also aims to run multiple clustering algorithm and try to check which algorithm gives a cluster which has a lesser intra-cluster distance and greater inter-cluster distance.

### Methodology:
 
#### Hopkins Statistic to assess the clustering tendency of the dataset.

#### K-Means Clustering Model

#### Hierarchical Clustering Model

#### DBSCAN Model

#### Silhouette Analysis for Evaluation of Analysis
